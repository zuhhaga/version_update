  <description>Waydroid uses Linux namespaces (user, pid, uts, net, mount, ipc) to run a full Android system 
in a container and provide Android applications on any GNU/Linux-based platform. 
The Android system inside the container has direct access to any needed hardware. 
The Android runtime environment ships with a minimal customized Android system image based on LineageOS. 
The image is currently based on Android 11.</description>
